They basically behaved like irresponsible children and I spent a considerable amount of the trip cleaning up after them, replacing keys they had lost drunk,  etc.\n\nI've personally moved to a more \"few drinks\" on the weekend approach and just can't handle the kind of \"session\" we had any more. Three days later, I'm still in recovery mode.\n\nHere's my question:\n\nAre my friends just immature or does the college style weekend drinking go on for far longer than I realized?  \nI know a few Irish people here and most have embraced the more Mediterranean style drinking culture.

I never got a contract and was told its because the landlord doesn't pay taxes. I was fine with it because I was paying very little. In hindsight, I should've ran the other way. \n\nFast forward, Amy can't get SUSI because she can't provide proof she is living in that house and paying rent. Landlord wrote a half-assed letter stating that she's only staying here and minding the house, not paying rent. She started working to try to pay college fees. She's still struggling.\n\nAfter Christmas, a different girl moved into a small bedroom in the house who said she will be moving out in mid May. She caused a lot of issues (being loud at night, parties, drinking, smoking in the house, invading privacy, etc) so we asked her to leave at the start/middle of April. She became aggressive and we contacted the landlord. The landlord then proceeded to say her behavior is okay and told me that I should leave and was ridiculously rude and unprofessional. I was insulted multiple times by the new girl and the landlord saw no wrong in this. Amy was already in the process of leaving.  \n\nI'm planning on moving everything out on Tuesday. I genuenly don't feel safe in the house because of the new girl and her friends. I also want to report the landlord for tax evasion and my questions are where and how. I'm completely clueless as to how things work in Ireland.\n\nI'm also not sure if I come across as a complete asshole. The situation has be extremely stressful. Any advice would be amazing. \n\nEdit; a detail I left out of my post was that the landlord doesn't actually own the house. Their mother does, and she is in the hospital. I'm honestly not even sure she knows the house is being rented.\n\nAnyway, thank you everyone for your help!!
